# hello-world
Initial repo for Github, hi Github!

## I'm gri-whal (grey whale).
I come to github for the promised land of commits, open source contributions and mostly the Octocat.

I started this account as a way to slightly abstract my real personhood from my github persona. This way I can practice and play around with ideas without the embarassment of being discovered.

## My goals in life: 
- Naps
- Code
- Learning

If you come from the future, please feel free to leave a note. I hope there are flying cars and life on Mars.
